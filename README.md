# freeDOM

One DOM to bring them all and in the browsers bind them.

What you're working with here is a lightweight version of jquery, with only the essentials needed to manipulate DOM.


## jQuery

jQuery (http://api.jquery.com/) is a library that allows user to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.  freeDOM is inspired by
jQuery and uses the DOM documentation by MDN(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) to 
provide the same following functionality:

### DOM Manipulation and Traversal

#### Manipulation
- empty
- html
- attr
- addClass
- removeClass

#### Traversal
- remove
- find
- children
- parent

### Event Handling
- on
- off

### Document Ready
- ready

### AJAX
- extend
- ajax

## Demo
In order to explore your new-found freeDOM, it is helpful to use the demo project available as the index.html file.  From there you can open up the JavaScript console (command + option + i) and use the various methods that come with freeDOM.
